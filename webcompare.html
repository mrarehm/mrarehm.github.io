	Two Good Websites One Bad.

		<h1> First Good Website Example</h1>
			<p>
				An example of a good website I found was the Scentsy website. I thought the home page was great. The page had a good layout. It had great use of white space. The navigations were very organized and easy to follow. The home page offers a lot of various navigation links so it’s important that it stays clean and organized. The whole website keeps an appealing theme throughout. Scentsy has pictures for all their products and all the pictures load quickly. Everything is also very clean looking and organized. When I looked at the HTML and CSS pages I was able to understand what was going on. There were very few things crossed out. The only downside to the website is that it is hard to get back to the home page, but it’s not necessary to go back to the home page because you can navigate throughout the website on all the pages. I wouldn’t say this website has anything that sets it apart from other websites but it has a very cute boutique design and great graphics. Which even though it is a very basic shopping website it has a very appropriate theme for its clients and target customers. The website is also all secure so customers can feel safer when buying items.

		<h1> Second Good Website Example</h1>
			<p>
				At first glance, the National Geographic website seems like a lot but it gives a huge sense of adventure which I feel is their main goal. The home page is somewhat easy to navigate. There is just so much content I feel it’s hard to make things simple. I think they did a good job with how much content the website provides. If you go to the drop-down menu it makes the navigation 10 times better. For as much content as National Geographic’s website provides I feel they do a good job of keeping things organized. I think the website sets itself apart from other websites similar to it because it uses pictures very effectively. There are cool graphics and short videos throughout the website. You get this sense that you need to go take a trip to see the Grand Canyon yourself. From what I understood from the HTML and CSS it looks very modern, and I could understand what was going on. There are just a lot of attributes and declarations that I don’t know. The only red flag is there is a lot of warnings, but as we have discussed before that is not always bad. The classic National Geographic theme is present throughout, and if you click the logo in the upper left corner of the page it takes you back to the home page. Overall I think this website does a very good job of keeping things organized. It utilizes white space well so that no space is wasted, but it also doesn't feel overwhelming.

		<h1> The Bad Website Example </h1>
			<p>
				I looked up examples of bad websites and Suzanne Collin’s (author of the Hunger Games series) website came up. Her website isn’t like the other over the top bad websites it looks like a website… it just looks like a website I could create. At first glance, the website is extremely boring. There are no cool designs or features that would set it apart from other websites. The website is very amateur looking. The home page has extremely horrible spacing and horrible use of white space. You can scroll on the page forever and it is nothing but white. I also noticed when you pull the window in and out all formatting is lost. I looked at the HTML and CSS work, and for some reason, I’m not sure why but a lot of the attributes and declarations are crossed out or faded. A lot of the HTML and CSS doesn’t seem to be working or are irrelevant. The only good thing about this website is it stays very consistent throughout. The layout and color scheme stays the same. It’s not good but at least it's consistent. I compared Collin’s website to J.K. Rawlings and it's embarrassing. Rowling’s website has this cool hipster coffee shop vibe, and it looks so professional and clean cut.
