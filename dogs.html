	<p> This website is dedicated to my love of dogs. Dogs have earned the title as man's best friend for many years. Cats have been becoming popular lately, but dogs are still holding onto their title as of right now. Dogs were domesticated between 14,000 and 6,400 years ago in Asia and Europe. </p>
	<p> Owning a dog can bring a person numerous health benefits, from mental health benefits to physical benefits. Just being around dogs on the daily can bring you many benefits. However, as great as it is to have a dog it should not be taken lightly. Owning a dog is about the same amount of responsibilty as having a child. Dogs depend on their owners a lot to be taken care of. Dogs are also very social animals, they don't do well when being left alone for long periods of time. They want to be around you as much as possible. Dogs really are mans best friend.</p>
