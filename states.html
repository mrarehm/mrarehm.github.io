<h1> Comparing State Websites </h1> 

<h2>States in order from my favorite to least favorite websites</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Nebraska</li>
			<a href="http://nebraska.gov" target="_new" title="Nebraska"> Nebraska's Website </a>
		<p>I picked Nebraska's website as my favorite because I really had no complaints about the website. I really liked the design of the whole website, how it was set up, and the color scheme that it had. I also thought it was super easy to naviagate from links within the website and outside the website. Also, on the terms of external links I liked how they would open a new tab so it was always easy to get back to the home page. The website is also phone friendly.</p>
	<li>Montana</li>
			<a href="http://mt.gov" target="_new" title="Montana"> Montana's Website</a>
		<p>Montana is number 2 on this list because it has fewer cons than the other websites and it didn't annoy me to use. The complaints I have about Montana's website is that the overall scheme and layout was very boring to me, but I do like all the background images they use. It also doesn't open a new tab when it changes pages. The positives of the website is that I find it very easy to navigate, and it's clear and easy to read. I also think it has a lot of good and helpful extra information. Another good thing is that it is phone friendly. </p>
	<li>Alaska</li>
			<a href="http://alaska.gov" target="_new" title="Alaska"> Alaska's Website</a>
		<p>I picked Alaska as 3rd because it really wasn't that bad of a website. The thing I find weird is it is not very phone friendly. That's annoying. I also noticed that not all the links it provides were secure links. The annoying thing I found was the deeper you got into the website the more confusing it got and the harder it was to get back to the home page. I do like the colors they use and I like how they are good about keeping the same theme throughout. I also like the home page it's very welcoming I think.</p>
	<li>Arizona</li>
			<a href="http://az.gov" target="_new" title="Arizona"> Arizona's Website</a>
		<p>The only reason Arizona isn't last is because I liked all the pictures they used. This website was so annoying to navigate through. You had to click on so many different links (that often were just repeating what you just clicked on) to get any where; then when you do find the exact link you want to go to they are all external, and it doesn't open a new tab. I got so annoyed of how many times I had to click on something. This page also took a long time to load. I'm not sure if that was Carroll's wifi or the website. However, a good thing is that it is very easy to get back to the home page, and the theme of the website is pleasing to look at. </p>
	<li>New Hampshire</li>
			<a href="http://nh.gov/index.htm" target="_new" title="New Hampshire"> New Hampshire's Website </a>
		<p>I really didn't like this website. I really dislike the design and set up of the whole website. While navigating through the website the design of each page changes, and I very much disliked that. I don't have alot to say about this website. It was very boring. There was a lot of white space, and no interesting/ eye catching images. </p>
